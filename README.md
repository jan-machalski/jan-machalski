## üëã Hi there. I'm Janek.

I'm a student of Computer Science and Information Technology at Warsaw University of Technology.
I'm especially interested in optimization of complex algorithms and building bots based on different algorithms.

## üöÄ Current projects
- **[ActiLink Backend](https://github.com/ActiLink/ActiLink-backend.git)**:
  Backend of the app [ActiLink](https://github.com/ActiLink/ActiLink-frontend.git) - a mobile app to help users connect with other people who have similar hobbies.
  The project uses technologies such as .NET 9.0, Entity Framework and Docker.
- **[Checkers Genetic](https://github.com/jan-machalski/CheckersGenetic.git)**:
  A C++ based checkers bot which optimizes evaluation by utilising genetic algorithm and tournament selection to find optimal heuristic weights.

## Some of my previous university projects

### Machine Learning
- **[Word recognition bot](https://github.com/andrucior/ML.git)**:
  A project implementing word recognition using PyTorch. It implements spectrogram generation and image recognition. Different models were trained in an attempt to find the best one.

### GPU programming in CUDA

- **[Monte Carlo Checkers](https://github.com/jan-machalski/Checkers-MonteCarlo.git)**:
  A checkers bot based on the [Monte Carlo tree search algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search). It utilizes GPU cores to maximize the number of simulations done each move.
- **[KMeans](https://github.com/jan-machalski/KMeans.git)**:
  A couple of different implementations of the [KMeans clustering algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering). GPU used to parallelize computations and speed up computation.

### .NET web programming
- **[DriveIt](https://github.com/JAWMini/DriveIt)**:
  A Blazor web app for a car rental company.

### Object oriented programming
- **[Flight tracker simulation](https://github.com/jan-machalski/Airplane-tracker.git)**:
  A simulation of a flight tracker utilizing many design paterns.

### C programming in linux
- **[linux-programming](https://github.com/jan-machalski/linux-programming.git)**:
  A few small programs I did as tasks and shared to help my friends pass the subject.

### Computer Graphics
- **[Polygon editor](https://github.com/jan-machalski/Polygon-Editor.git)**:
  A WinForms 2d polygon editing tool.
- **[Bezier surface visualizer](https://github.com/jan-machalski/gk---projekt-2.git)**:
  A WinForms 3d bezier surface visualizer.
- **[Image editor](https://github.com/jan-machalski/gk-Projekt-3.git)**:
  A WinForms tool to edit images using brush and various filter functions.

### Programming in graphical environment
- **[Mouse presenter](https://github.com/jan-machalski/Mouse-presenter.git)**:
  A WinApi app with a mouse cursor highlighting circle.
- **[Chat](https://github.com/jan-machalski/Chat.git)**
  A WinForms chat app implementing user and a TCP server.
